	 * Make it a lot like animal crossing-
	 * a few font sizes- small, normal, big, huge
	 * ability to add color to text
	 * ability to auto-color certain keywords
	 * ability to add special icons (cashmoney icon, controller icons, etc.)
	 * screen-based, i.e. wait for user input before each few lines, let user skip dialog by jamming button
